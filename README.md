# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub, and I'm a 21yo amateur Front-end developer (aspiring to be a full-stack someday!). 
I mainly work in Angular, I've got around a year and a half of noncommercial experience. 
Did a lot of simple projects, which have ended up scrapped due to my perfectionism.

## Currently working on: 

[SkillBuddy](https://github.com/plewajakub/skillbuddy-app)

SkillBuddy is an side project of an app that aims to help with self-development, made to experiment with APIs and quirks of web app developing process. 
Features such as setting up and pursuing set goals, observing own progress over time, overall a dashboard of positivity and motivation. 
Still early in development, but we plan to add more and more features, given the time.  

## Notable finished, dropped, or put on hold projects

Exceptionally fun project i was working on, unfortunately dropped due to external problems.
Utopia Vision, or, rather utopia-site is an e-commerce clothing store page, designed in an urban, 
neo-streetwear style grasping on the aesthetics of childhood video games (GTA San Andreas in this example).
Learned a lot, mostly about communication with a client and have gotten a really solid grasp on Angular development
(at least from a Junior dev perspective ðŸ˜„).

Really hoping to come back to this one!
