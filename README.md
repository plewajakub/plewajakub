# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub, and I'm a 21yo amateur Front-end developer! 
I mainly work in Angular, I've got around a year and a half of noncommercial experience. 
Did a lot of simple projects, recently started to work on bigger ones.

Open to collaboration on web-app projects!

## Currently working on: 

[SkillBuddy](https://github.com/plewajakub/skillbuddy-app)

My first serious collab fun project w/ @Wichtowski. SkillBuddyis an side project, an app that aims to help users with self-development, mainly being created
to practice new things in web dev and to work with graphs, which I just like to do...
End result should have features such as setting up new and pursuing set own goals, observing own progress over time, overall a dashboard of positivity and motivation.
Implement some workout routines, set reminders, incorporate recipes for healthy dishes etc. Little bit of everything. 
Still early in development, but we plan to add more and more features, given the time.   

## Notable finished, dropped, or put on hold projects
### [TuneHabits](https://github.com/plewajakub/tunehabits)

Had some fun with Spotify developer API, although the app needs approval from Spotify team for users (other than me ðŸ˜­) to be able to use it, I've learned quite some things
from creating it. Overall it was a nice project to practice working with many complex data objects. I plan to expand this app so it can be verified.

### [Utopia Vision](https://github.com/plewajakub/utopia-site/tree/master/utopia-site)

Exceptionally fun project i was working on, unfortunately dropped due to external problems.
Utopia Vision, or, rather utopia-site is an e-commerce clothing store page, designed in an urban, 
neo-streetwear style grasping on the aesthetics of childhood video games (GTA San Andreas in this example).
Learned a lot, mostly about communication with a client and have gotten a really solid grasp on Angular development
(at least from a Junior dev perspective ðŸ˜„).

Really hoping to come back to this one!
